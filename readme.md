# CNN Classification Project

A project for classifying images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This repository includes scripts for splitting datasets, training a CNN, and making predictions.

---

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.8**
- **TensorFlow**: For building and training the neural network.
- **Matplotlib**: For visualizing training progress and results.
- **SciPy**: For image preprocessing and transformations.

You can install the required Python packages with:
```bash
pip install tensorflow matplotlib scipy
```

## How to Run

Follow these steps to use the project:

### 1. Split Dataset
Use the `split_dataset.py` script to split your dataset into training, validation, and testing sets.

```bash
python split_dataset.py
```

Ensure the dataset is organized as follows before running:
```
dataset/
├── class_1/
├── class_2/
```

### 2. Train the CNN
Run the `cnn.py` script to train the CNN model on the dataset.

```bash
python cnn.py
```

During training, you can monitor the training and validation accuracy/loss through the logs or visualization (if implemented).

### 3. Predict with CNN
After training, use the trained model to make predictions on new images. Add a script or code block in `cnn.py` for prediction, if not already available.
